/*
Researching this tutorial problem showed there is a discussion in the C++ community over the use of pointers.
There's people like Ethan, saying how it's mainly used for interfacing with C libraries:

(He included some nice ways of using them when you have to!)

And then there's people like Rishi, who are more poetic about their use:
"We use pointers because it's easier to give someone an address to your home than to give a copy of your home to everyone.

(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/162941/why-use-pointers)

I like both their viewpoints - pointers are good for optimisation when using large data structures, but should be avoided where possible.
